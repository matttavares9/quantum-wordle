    "\n",
    "This project combines quantum computing concepts with an engaging and educational game format. Players will attempt to guess a hidden 5-letter word, leveraging various quantum algorithms to search for letters and positions in a quantum state space.\n",
    "\n",
    "**How to play Quantum Worlde:**\n",
    "- A hidden 5-letter word is encoded in a quantum state.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Players input guesses, and the game uses **Grover's Search Algorithm** to evaluate:\n",
    "\n",
    "    1. Correct letters in the *correct* positions. \n",
    "\n",
    "    2. Correct letters in *incorrect* positions.\n",

    "### **2. Quantum Game Mechanics**\n",
    "\n",
    "The excitement of this game lies in the \"quantum twists,\" which show the unpredictability of collapsing qubits and the unique capabilities of quantum computing. Based on the user's guess, different outcomes can occur based on which states are ultimately measured:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Correct Letter, Correct Position:**\n",
    "   - ~$50\\%$ chance correct letter is revealed with an *uppercase* letter.\n",
    "   - ~$50\\%$ chance **another** letter in the *hidden word* is revealed with *lowercase* letter and an aesteric to provide the user with the hint.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Correct Letter, Wrong Position:**\n",
    "   - ~$50\\%$ chance letter is revealed with a *lowercase* letter.\n",
    "   - ~$25\\%$ chance letter in word is revealed with an *uppercase* letter.\n",
    "   - ~$25\\%$ chance a random letter is revealed with a *lowercase* letter.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Incorrect Letter:**\n",

    "\n",
    "These mechanics create an element of strategy where players must deduce wether feedback is a hint, a random letter, a bonus word or just get lucky by the inherent quantum randomness!\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **2.1 Superposition**\n",
    "Letters are in equal super position with one another. This requires 5 qubits, as $N=2^5$ results 32 possible states, which is the closest we can get to 26 by base 2. Thus, each state has a probability amplitude of $\\frac{1}{32}$. This can be represented by the following notation:\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{N}}\\sum_{i=0}^{N-1}|i\\rangle = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{32}}(|00000\\rangle + |00001\\rangle + |00010\\rangle + ... |11011\\rangle + ... |11111\\rangle)\n",

    "Where each state is in order alphabetically: $A = |00000\\rangle$,  $B = |00001\\rangle $, $C = |00100\\rangle $ and $Z = |11011\\rangle $\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **2.2 Controlled-Y Rotations**\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The Controlled-Y Gate $CRY$ rotates the phase of the qubit to **amplify** the probability of measuring this state, **only** if the *control* qubit is $|1\\rangle$. This is represented by the following gate, which transforms the computational basis state:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "CRY = \n",
    "\\begin{bmatrix}\n",
    " 1& 0& 0& 0  \\\\\n",
    " 0& cos\\phi &0  & -sin \\\\\n",
    " 0& 0 &  1& 0 \\\\\n",
    " 0& sin\\phi &0  & cos\\phi\n",
    "\\end{bmatrix}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Where each column of the matrix represents the **input** state and the corresponding rows show the **output** transformation state. For a two qubit system, each in superposition: $$\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}(|0\\rangle +|1\\rangle)\\otimes_{}^{}\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}(|0\\rangle +|1\\rangle)=\\frac{1}{2}(|00\\rangle+|01\\rangle+|10\\rangle+|11\\rangle) $$\n",
    "\n",
    "##### **2.21. CRY Gates for Correct Letter, Correct Position:**\n",
    "This two qubit set up will be used to demonstrate the theory behind how the \"Correct Letter, Correct Position\" is revealed. Our goal is to **maximize** the $|11\\rangle$ state:\n",
    "\n",
    "After applying the $CRY$ gate, this state becomes:\n",
    "$$\\frac{1}{2}(|00\\rangle + [ cos\\phi|01\\rangle) +sin\\phi|11\\rangle] +|10\\rangle + [ -sin\\phi|01\\rangle) +cos\\phi|11\\rangle])$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Where $\\phi=\\frac{\\theta}{2}$. Next, set $\\theta=\\frac{\\pi}{2}$:\n",
    "$$\\frac{1}{2}(|00\\rangle + \\frac{\\sqrt{2}}{2}|01\\rangle+\\frac{\\sqrt{2}}{2}|11\\rangle+|10\\rangle-\\frac{\\sqrt{2}}{2}|01\\rangle + \\frac{\\sqrt{2}}{2}|11\\rangle)$$\n",
    "\n",
    "This simplifies the state by eliminating the $|01\\rangle$, resulting in:\n",
    "$$\\frac{1}{2}(|00\\rangle+\\sqrt{2}|11\\rangle + |10\\rangle)$$\n",
    "To measure the probabilities of each state, we must calculate the square of the absolute value of the amplitudes.\n",
    "Thus, the probability of measuring the $|11\\rangle$ state is $\\frac{1}{2}$, measuring the $|00\\rangle$ state is $\\frac{1}{4}$, and measuring the $|10\\rangle$ state is $\\frac{1}{4}$.\n",
    "In conclusion, if we map the $|11\\rangle$ state to the letter gussed by the player, the chances are ~$50\\%$, while mapping the remaining states to another letter in the hidden word, the chances cumulate to ~$50\\%$. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "##### **2.22 CRY Gates for Correct Letter, Wrong Position:**\n",
    "The goal of maximizing the $|11\\rangle$ state remains the same, except we need a wider range of probabilities. The theory is that the $|11\\rangle$ state will be mapped to the guessed letter, while the remaining states will be a selective cumulation of another letter in the hidden word and a random letter.\n",
    "\n",
    "Starting with the state after applying the $CRY$ gate:\n",
    "$$\\frac{1}{2}(|00\\rangle + [ cos\\phi|01\\rangle) +sin\\phi|11\\rangle] +|10\\rangle + [ -sin\\phi|01\\rangle) +cos\\phi|11\\rangle])$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Set $\\theta=\\frac{2\\pi}{3}$:\n",
    "$$\\frac{1}{2}(|00\\rangle+\\frac{1}2{}|01\\rangle +\\frac{\\sqrt{3}}2{}|11\\rangle +|10\\rangle-\\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2}|01\\rangle+\\frac{1}{2}|11\\rangle)$$\n",
    "And simplify:\n",
    "$$\\frac{1}{2}(|00\\rangle + \\frac{1-\\sqrt{3}}{2}|01\\rangle + |10\\rangle +\\frac{\\sqrt{3}+1}{2}|11\\rangle)$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Thus, the probability of measuring the $|11\\rangle$ state is $\\frac{2+\\sqrt{3}}{8}$, measuring the $|00\\rangle$ state is $\\frac{1}{4}$, measuring the $|10\\rangle$ state is $\\frac{1}{4}$, and measuring the $|01\\rangle$ state is $\\frac{2-\\sqrt{3}}{8}$\n",
    "Finally, if we map the $|11\\rangle$ state to the letter gussed by the player, the chances are just under $50\\%$, mapping the $|00\\rangle$ state to a letter in the word is ~$25\\%$,  and mapping the $|01\\rangle$ and $|10\\rangle$ states to a random letter is just over $25\\%$.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### **2.23 Incorrect Letter:**\n",
    "**No** $CRY$ gates are needed as a random letter of the alphabet will be revealed. Therefore, measuring state $\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{32}}(|00000\\rangle + |00001\\rangle + |00010\\rangle + ... |11111\\rangle)$ results in an equal $\\frac{1}{32}$ probability of measuring each letter. As you may have noticed, there are more qubits than letters. For each extra qubit, a random letter will be mapped to it.\n",

    "In this project, I’ve successfully implemented a quantum version of Wordle, demonstrating how quantum computing can enhance classical game mechanics. By leveraging quantum principles such as **superposition** and **controlled gates**, along with **Grover's search algorithm**, I was able to explore potential speedups and unique gameplay enhancements over traditional methods.\n",

Nonetheless, this project serves as a solid foundation for future work in quantum gaming and quantum algorithm development."
