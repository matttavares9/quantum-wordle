# Quantum Wordle: A Quantum Computing Word-Guessing Game

ðŸš€ **Quantum Wordle** combines the mechanics of a word-guessing game with the power of quantum computing. Using Qiskit, custom quantum circuits, and Groverâ€™s Algorithm, this project probabilistically identifies correct letters, making it a fun and educational way to explore quantum principles.

## Features
- Implements **Groverâ€™s Algorithm** to efficiently search for correct letters.
- Uses **quantum circuits** to generate probabilistic feedback based on player guesses.
- Demonstrates quantum principles like **superposition** and **measurement probabilities**.

## How It Works
Players guess letters of a hidden word, and the quantum circuits evaluate:

| Feedback Type                   | Probability        | Example Output       |
|---------------------------------|--------------------|----------------------|
| **Correct letters, correct positions** | ~50% chance correct letter is measured | `A` (uppercase)       |
|                                 | ~50% chance another letter in the word is measured | `b` (lowercase)       |
| **Correct letters, incorrect positions** | ~50% chance letter is measured         | `b` (lowercase)       |
|                                 | ~25% chance letter in the word is measured | `A` (uppercase)       |
|                                 | ~25% chance a random letter is measured    | `x` (lowercase)       |
| **Letters not in the word**     | Equal chance for any random letter         | `x` (lowercase)       |


Custom quantum circuits adjust measurement probabilities to provide feedback, while Groverâ€™s Algorithm amplifies the likelihood of finding correct letters.
