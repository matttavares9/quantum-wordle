# Quantum Wordle: A Quantum Computing Word-Guessing Game

ðŸš€ **Quantum Wordle** combines the mechanics of a word-guessing game with the power of quantum computing. Using Qiskit, custom quantum circuits, and Groverâ€™s Algorithm, this project probabilistically identifies correct letters, making it a fun and educational way to explore quantum principles.

## Features
- Implements **Groverâ€™s Algorithm** to efficiently search for correct letters.
- Uses **quantum circuits** to generate probabilistic feedback based on player guesses.
- Demonstrates quantum principles like **superposition** and **measurement probabilities**.

## How It Works
Players guess letters of a hidden word, and the game evaluates:

1. Correct letters in the *correct* positions.
2. Correct letters in *incorrect* positions.
3. Letters not present in the hidden word.

Custom quantum circuits adjust measurement probabilities to provide feedback, while Groverâ€™s Algorithm amplifies the likelihood of finding correct letters.
